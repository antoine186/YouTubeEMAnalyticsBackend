1) Extract python packages to install

pip freeze > requirements.txt

2) Get backend code into EC2 instance (THIS STEP COULD BE SKIPPED)

- Create new instance for backend with own security group
- Upload compressed zip file
- sudo apt-get install unzip
- unzip YouTubeEMAnalyticsBackend.zip -d ExtractedShellFolder
- rm YouTubeEMAnalyticsBackend.zip

3) Install relevant packages

- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt install python3-pip
- Use FileZilla to move extracted file outside of shell folder (COULD BE SKIPPABLE)
- Delete shell folder (COULD BE SKIPPABLE)
- cd YouTubeEMAnalyticsBackend (COULD BE SKIPPABLE)
- pip3 install gunicorn (COULD BE SKIPPABLE)
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt (COULD BE SKIPPABLE)
- You will likely encounter install issues + Fix those + Change requirements.txt file
using nano requirements.txt + CTRL+X + SHIFT+Y to save. (COULD BE SKIPPABLE)
Potential solutions include
	- Remove Scweet entry
	- python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
	- Remove psycopg2 from requirements.txt (You could skip this step)
	- sudo apt install libpq-dev
	- pip3 install psycopg2 (You could skip this step)
	- Remove save-thread-result from requirements.txt
	- pip3 install -U save-thread-result
	- Remove yt-videos-list from requirements.txt

4) Setup NGINX

sudo apt install nginx

Perform COMMAND 1 in LocationOfSettings.txt. Then copy-paste in text found in
NGINX_settings_text.txt.

5) Setup Gunicorn 

Perform COMMAND 2 in LocationOfSettings.txt. Then copy-paste in text found in
FLASKAPP_settings_text.txt.

6) Set up elastic IP in AWS

Allocate Elastic IP to AWS EC2 backend instance.

7) Set correct urls in the custom domain manager

Set Elastic IP Allocated IPv4 to the custom domain entries.

8) Create and activate certificates

- sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
- sudo certbot --nginx (Make sure port 80 is temporarily open for inbound)
- Enter both domains to encrypt: 1) www.domain.xyz & 2) domain.xyz

9) Restrict security group inbound and outbound rules

- For inbound authorised connections:
	- Allow from frontend security group
	- Allow from SSH over TCP on port 22
	- Allow All Traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 [FIGURE OUT BETTER WAY]
- For outbound authorised connections:
	- Allow to frontend security group
	- Allow to DB security group
	- Allow All Traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 [FIGURE OUT BETTER WAY]

10) Run prod version of backend
